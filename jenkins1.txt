freestyle project:

Jenkins freestyle projects allow users to automate simple jobs, such as running tests, creating and packaging applications, producing reports, or executing commands.

pipeline:

supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines

multi-configuration project:

Jenkins provides multi-configuration project. With this option we can create only one job with many configurations. Each configuration will be executed as a separate job. This is exactly what we need to simplify our scheduled tests, which can be used in conjunction with TestComplete.

Folder:

The Folders plugin allows you to organize jobs in hierarchical folders, much like how you organize files in directories in your file system. 

multi-branch pipeline:

Creates a set of Pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository(github).

organziation folder:

Creates a set of multibranch project subfolders by scanning for repositories.
